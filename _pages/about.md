I am a research scientist interested in AI & machine learning techniques and their applicaitons in computational geophysics. I finished my Ph.D. degree at Rice University focused on the development of advanced deep learning algorithrms and inversion methods for seismic velocity estimaiton problems.

Recent News
======
July, 2022:  serve as a technical geophysicist at Chevron working on the technical support and developments for scientific seismic imaging softwares (e.g., Gaussian Beam Migration; Least-square Reverse Time Migration). My developments include Java (front-end GUI), Python (data pipeline) and C++ (back-end algorithms).

May, 2022: I graduated from Rice University with a Ph.D. in computational geophysicist!
