Education
======
* Ph.D in Computational Geophysics, Rice University, 2022
* B.S. in Geophysics, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), 2016
* Exchange student, University of GÃ¶ttingen, 2015

Work experience
======
* 06/2022- : Technical Geophysicist
  * Chevron Energy Technology Company
  * User support and technical development of scientific seismic imaging software, including Gaussian-beam migration (iGBMig)
and least-squares reverse time migration (LSRTM), for the sub-salt imaging problems.
  * HPC resource coordinator and manager for the sub-salt imaging team.

* 06/2020-08/2020: Machine Learning-Earth Science Intern
  * Chevron Energy Technology Company
  * Code extension of 3D U-nets to multi-class semantic image segmentation for shallow hazards detection in large-scale seismic
volumes. Hyperparameters tuning and comparative studies of Focal loss, Tversky loss, Dice loss, Focal-Tversky loss and their
combinations. Application on production volumes and quantified results based on validation accuracy, IoU, and Dice coefficient.

* 09/2019-12/2019: Machine Learning Engineer Intern
  * SLB Digtal Foundation Center
  * Comparative study of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for seismic impedance inversion, including Cycle-GAN, Least-
square GAN, Wasserstein GAN and Wasserstein GAN-GP. Combining Wasserstein loss, cycle-consistent loss and gradient
penalty loss and developed Wasserstein Cycle-GAN for improved impedance inversion with an example on 3D seismic volume.

* 05/2019-08/2019: Machine Learning-Earth Science Intern
  * Chevron Energy Technology Company
